# Bamazon
A node CLI app

## Challenge #1: Customer View
Application will be able to display all of the items available for sale when it is first run. It will show the customer the ids, names, and prices of the products for sale. Then the application will ask the customer what they would like to purchase, by using the product's id, and how many units of the product they would like to buy. Depending on how many units the customer is asking for, the application will let the customer know if the purchase can be made or if there are insufficient stock of that product. If the purchase can be made, the database will be updated and the application will show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
